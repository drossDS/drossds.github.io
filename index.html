                            <p>Developed a pricing model to estimate Boston Airbnb listing prices. Used web scraping, APIs, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to engineer features. Implemented a recommender system using cosine similarity to suggest listings based on user inputs. The pricing model outperformed the null model by reducing the root mean squared error from $86 to $49 and achieved an R-Squared value of 0.68 on validation data with outliers removed.</p>

                                <li>
                                    Fulfilled customer orders by modifying standard products to meet special customer applications. Delivered solutions for high temperature applications (above 1000F) where components are highly susceptible to "creep" and stress relaxation. Collaborated extensively with Principal, Consulting, and Chief Consulting Engineers to verify design methodology and ensure safety.
