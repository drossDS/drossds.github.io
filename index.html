                            <p>Developed a pricing model to estimate Boston Airbnb listing prices. Used web scraping, APIs, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to engineer features. Implemented a recommender system using cosine similarity to suggest listings based on user inputs. The pricing model outperformed the null model by reducing the root mean squared error from $86 to $49 and achieved an R-Squared value of 0.68 on validation data with outliers removed.</p>

                            <p>Built image classification models employing both convolutional and pre-trained neural network models to classify the severity of Alzheimerâs disease in MRI images. The model achieved an accuracy of 71% across four severity classes and improved upon the null model accuracy of 50%.  A second binary classification model was developed focusing on detecting very early stages of dementia by training on only two severity classes, achieving an accuracy of 81%, an improvement over the null model accuracy of 59%.</p>
